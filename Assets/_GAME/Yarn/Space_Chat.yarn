Hello? Hello, are you awake? 

-> What... what is this place?
	This is a starfreighter. Or at least what's left of one.
-> Who are you?
	There's no time for that now.
-> How long was I asleep?
	I assume you were unconcious. 

I'm afraid this is an emergency.

-> Emergency? What kind of emergency?

The ship is in a critical state. I don't know who you are, but I hope I can trust you.
The automatic oxygen generation is offline.

-> Oxygen? 
-> That sounds important.

I'm afraid so. Oxygen is not necessary for my continued functioning, but I believe it is for yours.
If we don't keep you supplied with oxygen, it will be difficult for you to improve the condition of the ship.

-> How long do I have?
	Not very long. 
-> What do we do?
	There is not much I can do. My hardware integrations are largely offline.

But I can show you what to do. Look to the upper right corner of your HUD. Do you see that blue pressure meter? 

-> I see it.

That's a readout of the oxygen supply. It's at about 0.3 now and falling. 

-> How do I stop it?

It will continue to fall as long as you are breathing, I'm afraid. So our goal should not be to stop it.
